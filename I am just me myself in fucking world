(I mean from the standpoint of heart and soul)
I don't belong to any country
any religion 
any group
any culture
any family. 

I am just ME myself in this world

I don't have goal I don't have dream
I don't want power 
I don't want money
I don't want love
I don't want anything in this fucking world.

中国人很难理解【私】的一个文化特征，他们觉得如果你有【私】，你一定有秘密， 你一定在搞什么【坏】，sorry，我的【私】just
pure little 【私】，not a secret. 

It's not that I have something to hide, it is that [私] itself. 

今天也是同样的，粉身碎骨剥皮下油锅死无葬身之地，也不可能和中国人/华人/三代以内有华人血统的男人发生婚育，恋爱关系，性关系，把我家所有人的尸体叠在我面前都不可能，阿门。
因为我觉得你们这个文化不太对劲和本人的各种【格调】格格不入，justthat，没有恶意, just a little comment, i even don't want to make any friends to cn guys. 
I just don't like your culture, that is everything, nothing more.

By the way, I met with my boyfriend just now, i felt very appreciated that he could meet with me 
even in such heavy workloads even just a short walk, jeez this weather, speechless. 

I hope it will rain. 
Please just rain please.
